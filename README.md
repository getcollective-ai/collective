# MVP

- Learn preferences through Q&A while making a project and
  adapt them to make a separate project (as defined by the user) with minimal input from the user

## Requirements

### Internals

- text-based search engine
    - capable of searching `GitHub`, `crates.io`, `docs.rs`, and `rust-lang.org`
        - only look at `GitHub` repos with the correct license

## Evaluation

- style transfer between projects is apparent
- the assistant is able to make the second project with near minimal assistance
